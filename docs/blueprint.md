## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700), inspired by the golden era of maritime exploration, and to represent the wealth of memories contained within the opera.
- Background color: Near-black (#0A0A0A) to create a sense of depth and mystery, like the deep sea.
- Accent color: Pale Yellow (#C0A062), for highlights and interactive elements, drawing the user's eye without overwhelming the design.
- Headline font: 'Cormorant Garamond', a serif font lending elegance and artistic sensibility to headlines.
- Body font: 'Lato', a sans-serif font that provides a clean, readable counterpoint to 'Cormorant Garamond.'
- Minimalist outline icons in yellow to provide visual cues without cluttering the layout.
- Subtle fade-in animations on page load and transitions to enhance user experience.
